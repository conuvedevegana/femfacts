# FEMFACTS 

Welcome to the Femfacts repository, where you can collaborate by adding more features. 


## Project: did you know that

We are going to create a single page application (SPA) that calls an external API and returns interesting facts at random.

This project shows how to make an API call with fetchApi. The API used is the " name" , and is used to obtain information about the " Curious Facts ".


## Technologies

[JavaScript: Browser-side technology]
[DOM: Is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-constructed XML documents.]
[Vite: is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and more agile development experience for modern web projects.]
[Vitest : It is used to perform native Vite unit testing with support for ESM, TypeScript y JSX powered by esbuild]
[HTML/CCS : They provide great interactivity and dynamism to the sites, allowing the development of both animations and objects in the front-end]
